This script allows you to upload the current file via Transmit directly from Vim. For it to work, you need to be working on a file that's tied to a Transmit connection, and this connection must have "DockSend" enabled.

The default key combination is Control + U to upload the active file.

Source is at http://github.com/tmallen/transmit-vim, but for the most part I'll be quick to push updates to this page.

Project Integration
------------------------
Take a look at proj.vim, which includes a "docksend" option that uploads files immediately on save: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2719
